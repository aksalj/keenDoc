# keenDoc
API documentation inspired by [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api). The UI was originally based on [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate).

### Usage

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/keenDocs.git docs
$ cd docs
$ npm install && bower install
```

Modify `config/default.json` to your liking then

```shell
$ npm start
```

Now you can start writing your `markdown` documentation in `source/*.md`.
